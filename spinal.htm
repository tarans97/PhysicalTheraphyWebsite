<center><h1>What Can Spinal Decompression Do For You?<h1></center>
<center><h2>The New Treatment for Low Back Pain.... Spinal Decompression<h2></center>
<p>In the past, a patient suffering from disc problems usually was given pain medications, instructed to refrain from physical activities, referred for physical therapy, and
 when they were not progressing they were sent for spinal surgery. Conservative chiropractic
 care proved very helpful in many cases, yet there have been some cases when surgery seemed to be the only other option... until now.

Today, you don't have to live with that pain anymore. Thanks to the concerted efforts of a team of top physicians and medical engineers, 
Spinal Decompression was developed to effectively treat lower back pain and sciatica resulting from herniated or deteriorated discs. Spinal Decompression not only significantly 
reduces back pain in many patients, but also enables the majority of patients to return to more active lifestyles.</p>

<center><h1>Does Spinal Decompression really work?</h1></center>

<p>Spinal Decompression has been proven effective in relieving the pain associated with bulging and herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, sciatica, and even relapse or failed back surgery. Since its release, clinical studies have revealed an amazing success rate in treating lumbar disc related problems with Spinal 
Decompression 
 
<center><h1>How does it work?<h1></center>
<p>Spinal Decompression uses state of the art technology that gently stretches the spine by applying a distraction force to relieve nerve compression. By changing the force and position of the spine, pressure is relieved from your nerves and spinal disks. Bulging, degenerating or herniated disks are often associated with low back pain and sciatica, therefore, alleviating this pressure may result in your injured spinal discs retracting into their proper 
position. This retraction can also encourage spinal disc healing as it allows oxygen, water, and nutrient-rich fluids help your discs to improve your overall spinal health. Spinal Decompression benefit spinal discs by allowing them to regain their health, maintain mobility,
 and offer patients a pain-free life. </p>
	<center><h1>Relieve your pain the natural way!</h1></center>
	<p>If you're looking for pain relief without the need for drugs or surgery, Spinal Decompression can be your answer. Spinal Decompression treatment can help you avoid costly
	and complicated medical procedures while allowing your body to heal naturally.  Performed by our Vista chiropractor through the use of FDA approved technology, sessions are 
	
	short and painless with treatment lasting just a few weeks and pain relief occurring after just a few sessions.</p></div>
