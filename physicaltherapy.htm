Physical Rehabilitation is administered to help restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain, and prevent or limit permanent physical disabilities of patients suffering from injuries or disease. Physical therapy treatment aims to restore, maintain, and promote overall fitness and health. Patients that may require physical therapy include: accident victims and individuals with disabling conditions such as low back pain, arthritis, heart disease, fracture (bone)s, head injuries,
 and cerebral palsy.

The focus of our Physical Therapy Department is on strengthening our patients, so they hold their adjustments and get the maximum benefit from their treatment program.
 Our rehab department also works with patients to gain range of motion and assist with stretching exercise.

If you're suffering from long-term chronic pain, physical therapy is your answer. Our physical therapists will work with you during your recovery to ensure you see the benefits that can result in healthier lifestyle.

<h1>Physical Therapy and Chiropractic Care<hr color="grey"></h1>

<div class="f3">Physical therapy rehabilitation paired with chiropractic care is a powerful combination. Able to provide benefits that aren't seen when done solely alone, a chiropractic
 treatment regimen combined with physical therapy can result in an improved quality of life with less pain for patients. Vista Chiropractic will help determine whether your 
 rehabilitation will benefit from additional chiropractic care. Our chiropractors and physical therapists work hand-in-hand to ensure you have the exact treatment that will
